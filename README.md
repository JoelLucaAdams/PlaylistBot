# ManPageBot

A discord bot that will query the man pages of the OS it is running on. Created by Joel Adams engineering, inspired by the CompSci Community Hub. This is an open source project so feel free to suggest any issues or contribute to the code / design.

## Setup

Before using the bot you must create a `.env` file which includes the line `DISCORD_TOKEN=` followed by a discord token.

## Usage

Users can query man pages using the following commands:

`!man ls` - returns a man page containing information on the command ls
