# PlaylistBot

A discord bot that will allow users to add and delete songs from public playlists. Created by Joel Adams engineering, inspired by the CompSci Community Hub. This is an open source project so feel free to suggest any issues or contribute to the code / design.

## Setup

Before using the bot you must create a `.env` file which includes the line `DISCORD_TOKEN=` followed by a discord token.

## Usage

Users can add songs to playlists using the following commands:

`!yt add <playlist_index> <youtube_link>` - allows user to add music to a public playlist

`!yt playlists` - prints off a list of all the playlists available
